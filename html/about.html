            Our school is designed to create a safe and happy environment for
            the growth and education of our children. Everything was put
            together with children in mind. The whole facility is bright and
            colorful with plenty of natural light. A beautiful creative mural
            and the aquarium keeps children interested, excited, and fascinated
            in the reception area. All classes have windows looking in so
            parents and staff can observe the children. Classrooms are designed
            for all age groups, and they are color themed. There’s always time
            for play. Our school has 2 playgrounds outdoors for different age
            groups and one indoor play area. The equipment has been chosen with
            safety in mind and they are age appropriate for all the children.
            Rubber material is used so children can play and run safely.

            Here at CCC we understand that a healthy diet is critical to
            physical and mental childhood development. We have spent a
            significant amount of time researching all healthy organic and
            natural choices that are good for our children. Organic Life stands
            above the rest in this very important campaign for healthier
            children. We know that this company is the best partner and provider
            of meals for our precious children.

            We know that children learn best when they're actively engaged.
            Children have the opportunity to discover their own special talents
            and best ways to learn while feeling valued for who they are, while
            having the guidance and freedom to learn in meaningful ways. We
            believe that all children are talented, capable, and special,
            whether they enjoy music or math. We know they learn Science, Math,
            Reading and Writing concepts through hands-on, sensory-oriented
            activities. Creative Kidz’ unique curriculum gives children the
            guidance and freedom to construct their own body of knowledge in
            ways most meaningful to them.
