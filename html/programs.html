                “Primary Care” is the key phrase in understanding the quality of
                care your baby will receive as a part of our Infant Care
                Program. Each teacher is assigned a group (no more than 4) of
                infants to care for. They work hand in hand with each parent to
                create a specialized care plan for the children in their group.
                We offer a safe, warm, and loving environment affording each
                Infant the best opportunities for growth. We foster this growth
                through exploration of the world around them. They have access
                to our centers as well as our Bye-Bye buggies and will take
                rides on days when weather permits. Each child is provided with
                their own crib and sheets. These are never shared by multiple
                students and are disinfected as well as laundered several times
                per day. We use neutral cleaning products and steam to disinfect
                this room limiting any harsh chemicals our infants may come into
                contact with. To keep our Infant room clean and germ free we
                restrict access by anyone other than our Infants and Teachers.
                We do this in hopes of keeping the germs of the outside world
                from entering the class. All of our caring Infant Room Staff
                treat each child as though he/she is their own. They are also
                trained in Infant CPR, First Aid, and we have other staff
                members with Medication Administration (MAT) training.

              <div class="program-text">
                Our teachers set goals with our parents and work with each
                Infant to reach certain developmental milestones. We use
                educational activities that focus on; rolling over, walking,
                grasping, crawling, pulling up, and mastering of fine motor
                skills. Each day the Infants will take part in several group
                circle times intended to aid in verbal communication and social
                interaction. Our staff will engage them in singing songs,
                reading stories and playing with sensory objects. Our educators
                also teach American Sign Language as an alternative form of
                communication.

                Our Toddler room is full of action and adventure! This room is
                designed to aid in the growth and development of a toddler by
                the completion and the refining of skills learned in our Infant
                room. Children are given the opportunity to increase core
                strength, fine and large motor skills, walking, running,
                jumping, and communication. Addressing these skills is very
                important for the future success of the children. Our schedule
                in this class allows the student time to play, learn, rest, and
                explore the world around them. Circle times include the
                introduction of colors, shapes, date, time, music, and movement.
                Throughout the day the class will sit down together for a few
                minutes of group learning. Students will interact socially
                together and with the teachers to make learning fun. By using
                flashcards, sign language, and sensory boxes our teachers aid
                the children in learning with all of their senses. The students
                in this class will engage in table activities each day that
                focus on strengthening their fine motor skills as well as their
                ability to follow simple directions. Our children also have the
                opportunity to express themselves through guided and free art
                activities several times weekly.

                Our Two Year Old Room is set up for what in some cases can be
                the most difficult time in a child’s life; the year in which a
                child may be expected to start caring for his/her self: using
                the bathroom, wiping, washing their hands, dressing themselves,
                and proper eating etiquette. We strive to give each two year old
                child a sense of routine and structure that will aid in
                mastering each of these valuable skills.

                Our bathroom is set up specially in order to accommodate potty
                training with two separate bathrooms and potties side by side at
                different heights. This allows 2 children to use the bathroom
                together helping to eliminate any anxiety or fear that might
                occur. We have smaller potties which allow small children to
                feel comfortable and at peace with the potty itself. Group potty
                time helps with the younger children who learn by watching a
                child that has already mastered the proper technique. We also
                have a potty that is standard size which allows the children,
                who have mastered the smaller potties, to practice the routine
                of placing and using a step stool and the proper placement and
                removal of a potty seat.

                At this age our children’s brains are like sponges. Our
                teachers’ goal each day is to educate and expose our students to
                the world around them. Our class has two circle times per day
                which are designed for group interaction and the establishment
                of a time to focus on instruction. After circle time the class
                breaks up into smaller groups for free play and guided
                activities. Each student will have one on one activity time with
                a teacher developing fine motor skills and creativity through
                art and expression. Our students also participate with stories,
                puppet play, and song and dance times daily.

                This is the first class in our center that begins our students’
                preparation for school. We have a core curriculum based on the
                Virginia Standards of Learning. We work closely with the Augusta
                Count School system, and teach from the “Blueprint Curriculum.”
                Our Preschool Class goes through a year-long process of
                exploration and exposure to our world, while honing the basic
                skills needed for advancement into our Jr. Kindergarten class.
                Our teachers follow a weekly thematic calendar designed to
                expose the children to what is happening in our world at that
                time. The teachers focus class discussions, stories, worksheets,
                and circle times within each of these weekly themes. Circle
                times last between 20 and 30 minutes each day and gradually grow
                in dynamic as the students learn new material. Telling time,
                date, colors, shapes, counting, Spanish, Math, patterns, letter
                and number recognition, name recognition, and writing all occur

                classroom setting. We focus our efforts on teaching our students
                everything they need to know before entering kindergarten. This
                program was established under the supervision of our area’s
                local kindergarten teachers. They supported us in our efforts to
                create a class that was structured to resemble the kindergarten
                classes in our local school system. They provided us a list of
                skills that would make our student’s transition to local school

                conducted each day under the supervision of our certified
                teachers. We focus on letter recognition, handwriting, one to
                one correspondence, patterns, telling time, math, and counting.
                Our students learn to follow multi-step directions given during
                class activities. They also work on writing short sentences,
                sight words, spelling, grammar, Spanish, adding, subtracting,
                reading, and cognitive skills. We strive to give our children

                can run, jump, play dodge ball and enjoy other fun activities.
                Check out our 25 ft. Bouncy House with double slides and a
                basketball hoop. Our staff is there to help our students with
                their homework every day after school, as well, which frees up
                more time at home to be spent with family or extracurricular
                activities. We transport children to and from local schools in
                the Augusta County and Waynesboro City school districts. Before
                school and after school care is available for those school
                systems as well. Our drivers are trained, licensed and insured
                for the transportation of students too! Look for one of our vans
                if you ever pick you child up from school!!

                nature hikes, and the Massanutten Water Park. We invite guest

                their experiences as part of your child’s summer curriculum. Our
                teachers are some of the brightest and most dedicated teachers
                in this field. We have licensed educators, and future teachers,
                both men and women who can provide a well-rounded fun
                educational summer experience for our campers. All our summer
