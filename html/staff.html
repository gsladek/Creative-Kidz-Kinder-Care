              Hello! I'm Teacher Kathy, and I'm the Co-Teacher for the teaching
              center. I started as a floater/substitute in February of 2012 and
              am very excited to now be able to dedicate myself to the Jr.
              Toddler class full time! I have a bachelor’s degree in music
              education from University of Akron and continuing education in
              Early Childhood. I've worked with kids of all ages since I was one
              myself. I love working with children because they're so honest,
              fun-loving and do and say the most outrageous things! I find
              myself laughing a lot when I'm with them. I love to see them learn
              and grow as they discover and experience the world around them.
